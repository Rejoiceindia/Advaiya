## Funding & Investment

I believe we can be bootstrapped during the whole life cycle of this project i.e. self funded from my existing real estate business and it's operations.


## What makes us different from other startups?

The fact that we already have a proven and well established revenue generation model that provides for many realtors including me and my family in a high end suburbs of Mumbai.

Hence our firm could be categorised as a fast-paced startup as we skip ideation, market creation etc all of those stages directly into growth phase.


## Formula for growth

To scale and push the business into growth phase all we need to do is increase the number of transactions per month simply by integrate 2 t's within current business operations. Those 2 t's being:

The Right Team: Long term partners driven by same vision and hunger for a mutual growth.
The Right Tech: Systems with AI /LLM at its core (due to their context understanding capabilities).

## Technology Development Plan

In today's era digital networking has become a basic necessity for all, be it professionals, businesses or for personal use within our family and friends.

Infact strong networking is lifeline of any successful real estate business venture, hence we plan to create a Decentralized Real Estate Ecosystem through open-source technologies, implemented in two phases:

Phase 1: Advaiya - For Internal Team Only.

Focus: To  develop LLM driven systems for internal use.

Project Name: “Advaiya” (Sanskrit word for “non-dual” or “unique” and is feminine).

Project Description: Advaiya, she is your intelligent Real Estate AI Assistant with custom knowledge base. She can run, manage, automate and streamline repetitive and routine business operations with minimal to no human intervention, allowing you to focus on your core revenue - generation activities within any real estate business operations.

Purpose: Automation & Streamlining of repetitive and routine operations, thus realtors can focus on non replicable human touch and customized experience which is their USP and their core revenue generation activity.

Phase 2: FOS Network - Public-Facing Platform to reclaim your Virtual Space.

Focus: To open and expand our systems to larger audience we develop a server network that blends best of “Fediverse” with “Matrix.org”, and can be effortlessly automated & managed using Advaiya.

Project Name: “Federated Opensource Server Networks” or “FOS Network”.

Project Description: Inspired by “Fediverse” and “matrix.org”, “Federated Opensource Server Networks” shortened to “FOS network” is a revolutionary opensource platform that empowers everyone, from individual users, to big firms, to reclaim not just their “Virtual Identity” but their “Virtual Space”.

Purpose: To break free from the clutches of centralised systems and embrace collaborative power of decentralised community-driven business ecosystem using opensource technologies. 

Thus with “Advaiya” and “FOS Network”, aim is to create a transparent, easy to use, secure, and collaborative ecosystem where real estate professionals and clients can connect, thrive and grow without any interference of giant tech firms, government etc.

## Sponsorships & Grants

Only after successful implementation of POC/ MVP and creation of a detailed road map to scale, any grants, sponsorship and collaboration with other realtors would be welcome.
