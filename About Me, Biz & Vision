## About me

Namaste, I'm Prashant, a realtor with a decade of experience in this business. We have our own real estate firm with its operations spread across western suburbs of Mumbai.
I am also passionate about agriculture/farming and have strong alignment towards open-source and decentralized technologies.


## About the Business

We currently have two distinct verticals:
Investment Vertical: Expertly managed by my father.
Service Vertical: Under my direct management, driving customer-centric customized services.

Additionally, we are actively developing two innovative verticals:

Rejoice India Proptech  with a vision to Revolutionise Real Estate Tech with Opensource.
Rejoice Estate Management Services with vision to help build, run & operate, customized & scalable Land Ventures, throughout India & world.


## Vision for the Future

Ultimate vision is to scale the business to a point where it can be listed on a major stock exchange, such as the NSE or BSE.


## Collaborative Hybrid Approach

I believe the Industrial era is long gone and the world has shifted towards an era of community driven business models.

Example:
Apple initially started as a product driven company, but now their sales are driven by loyal community that is constantly nourished and nurtured by the brand.
Patanjali that today rivals age old FMCG brands is most recent example of the same. It started with a community created by Baba Ramdev, from wherein resources were pooled together to create products that were sold to members within the community itself. Now these products are extensively being exported across borders, thanks to the organic  growth of their community, it's on the verge of becoming a trusted global brand.

Hence I believe business of real estate especially in India has been for too long within an unorganised chaos with no accountability and needs a radical shift driven by un-corporate hybrid approach that shall be discussed further within multiple parts of the documentation and discussion within this GitHub repo.
